# Voltorb Flip

I thought it would be fun to get some [Elm](elm-lang.org) practice by implementing
[Voltorb Flip](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Voltorb_Flip).
I discovered Voltorb Flip while playing [Pokemon Uranium](http://www.pokemonuranium.com/),
and originally called it "Uranium Minesweeper," but Pokemon fan corrected me.

If you are an Elm developer, I would love any feedback you have to offer.
